# PlaneGame

This is a clone of a hobbyist game I loved years ago. I think I found that on the CD that accompanied an issue of the german gaming magazine *GameStar*.

To find out what I have planned take a look at the [game design doc](https://github.com/tanuva/planegame/blob/master/GDD.md).

# Setup
To actually run the game, you'll need an additional big blob of binary data that can be [downloaded separately](https://nightsoul.org/files/planegame/planegame_data.tar.gz). This is done so that the binary data doesn't clutter the repository too much.
